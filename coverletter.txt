Dear Carousell,

	I've been looking for a small/medium sized start-up, where my existence would make
a difference, somewhere that could give me excitement where "work doesn't feel like work".

	Then I came across the Carousell's career page a few months back and saw an opening
on the 'Software Backend Engineer' position. I was overjoyed as it was a position that I was
deeply interested in and a community that I would really love to join.

	I have always wanted to work in a SaaS start-up where I can focus on working on
projects that provides a valuable service to the community. My previous company, Trinax
PTE LTD (which was great) was a consulting business where I spent much time facing clients
 and building web-applications that were mostly event-focused and would be tore down in a
 couple of days or weeks time-span

	During the period of working as a Web Developer in Trinax PTE LTD. I have
built web applications for multiple companies such as Macallan, BreadTalk,
Pocari Sweat, DBS, SK-II, etc.

	As you can see from my testimonials. I am someone who works hard and desire
challenges. I may not be very experienced, but what I lack in age, I make up in my pace
of learning. I'm not afraid to be always learning new technology, nor taking up multiple
roles.

	I would love to have the opportunity to come in for an interview at your earliest
convenience. If you require any additional information, I can be contacted at +65 91189793,
 or you can send an email to "maxgohjh@gmail.com".

	Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. Please take a look at the

Yours Sincerely,
Max Goh
